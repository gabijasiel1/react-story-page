# React Static Page with Git/GitHub

This is a React app I made for my assignment. It shows the story "The Tortoise and the Hare" on one page. I used three components: Header (the title), Content (a few paragraphs about the story), and Footer (the moral). I created the app with npx create-react-app and put the components in a folder called components inside src.

## How to run it

1. Clone the repo and go into the folder:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gabijasiel1/react-story-page.git
   cd react-story-page
   ```

2. Go into the app folder and install:
   ```
   cd story-app
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

That's it.
