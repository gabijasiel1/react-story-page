# The Tortoise and the Hare – React Static Story Page

A simple React single-page app that displays the classic fable **The Tortoise and the Hare**, built to practice Git/GitHub workflows and component-based layout.

## Description

This project is a static React page with:

- **Header** – Story title
- **Content** – A short summary of the story in 2–3 paragraphs
- **Footer** – The moral/lesson of the story

Each section is its own component (`Header.js`, `Content.js`, `Footer.js`).

## Folder Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Header.js
│   ├── Content.js
│   └── Footer.js
├── App.js
└── index.js
```

## Steps to Set Up and Run the App

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven’t already):
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```

2. **Go into the app folder**:
   ```bash
   cd story-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The story page should load with the header, content, and footer.
