        A hare was making fun of a tortoise for moving so slowly. The tortoise,
        tired of the teasing, challenged the hare to a race. The hare, confident
        in his speed, laughed at the idea but agreed. When the race began, the
        hare dashed ahead and was soon so far in front that he decided to take a
        nap under a tree, sure that he had plenty of time to win.

        The tortoise never stopped. He plodded along slowly but steadily,
        step by step, while the hare slept. When the hare finally woke up, he
        was shocked to see the tortoise had passed him. He ran as fast as he
        could toward the finish line, but it was too late—the tortoise had
        already crossed it and won the race.

        The animals who had gathered to watch cheered for the tortoise. The hare
        learned that overconfidence and laziness can lead to defeat, while
        persistence and determination can lead to success, no matter how slow
        the pace.
